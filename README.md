# notewood

Notewood is a simple note taking app which focuses on mindful note taking. This is achieved by always focusing on the current week and only be available to add notes to it. Relevant are also the tags, which can be added to each note. Through this, the topics of the week should always be recognizable at a glance. Past weeks can still be called up easily and the notes can be edited.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Sass, JavaScript, node.js, express, MongoDB, mongoose, ejs, moment.js

The app is built in the MVC architecture. For the backend node.js, express and MongoDB with mongoose were used. This aspect was also started with in the development. As template-engine ejs was used, which can be found in the views folder of the app. For easier use of the date of each note moment.js was used. This made it easier to sort the notes according to the week. For the client-side JavaScript, OOP principles were used, for example in the modal component.

## Optimizations:

Of course there is always room for improvement e.g. refactoring. For the features, I plan to integrate the tags more into the app in the future. For example, the tags will serve as clickable filters for the notes. I'm also planning to add various quality of life features, such as visual feedback after entering the tags.

## Lessons Learned:

The app is deliberately kept simple in terms of functionality and design. The main goal was to get a better understanding of the MVC architecture and to learn how to better integrate the backend into the app. The work on client-side JavaScript was also used to be able to implement working with classes in JavaScript.
